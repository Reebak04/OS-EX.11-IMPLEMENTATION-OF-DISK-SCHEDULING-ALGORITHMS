# OS-EX.11-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DISK-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS
## FIRST COME FIRST SERVE
## AIM:
To write a program for the first come first serve method of disc scheduling.
## ALGORITHM:
Disk scheduling is schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk.

It is important because: -

Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.

Two or more request may be far from each other so can result in greater disk head movement. Hard drives are one of the slowest parts of the computer system and thus need to be accessed in an efficient manner

FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.
